Therefore, I have also developed a hobby which is according to my taste and I can perfectly spend my free time. My hobby is drawing and painting. Drawing is a source to express your emotions graphically and painting acts as a catalyst for drawing.
When I have nothing to do, I pick up my sketch box and a paper and starts drawing. It gives me pleasure. Whenever I draw something, I feel myself filled with passion.

I draw caricatures, cartoons, comic characters and the sketches. I feel myself in the world of imagination. I consider

When I sit for drawing, I feel that my mind has opened, a cascade of ideas start flowing in my mind. I draw these ideas,and after these ideas to draw on page i feel very relax and happy.

Not only this, I have also decorated my house with small designs. When guests come to my house, their faces become happy by seeing drawings. I love my hobby.</font></h2></p>
