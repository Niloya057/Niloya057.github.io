		<p><h2><font size="08" face="Gabriola">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI think we all want to get well known and earning more money. If we only code, with no creativity, we would always find ourselves coding other one's creatives.

Being more has been my struggle for a while.
Which now I think is more of an inborn talent rather to be adventitious.

My goal is to be a passionate inspiring and creative developer that will be able to invent and innovate; also share and teach others in a way that they can be excited like I am about programming. Last but not least be a competent freelancer.</font></h2></p>
